Hello, and welcome to my personal website! Above you will find a link to my resume, as well as a link to my math resources website. My math resources website hosts all the notes I have either prepared for my students, or created to advance my independent studies. This website serves as a platform to showcase my personal projects and developments. Over time, my goal for this website is to host R and Python programming projects regarding data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. To browse the projects I have completed thus far, please refer to the title bar and select the “Projects” page. My story and background can be found on the “About” page, and you can contact me directly though the “Contact Me” tab. I hope you find the projects and resources helpful, I am looking forward to hearing from you!  

Regards,

-Jeremy Kight
