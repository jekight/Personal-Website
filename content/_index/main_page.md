Hello, and welcome to my personal website! Above you will find links to my resume, as well as, a link to my math resource website. My math resource website host all of my notes I have either presented to my students or have created for my independent studies. This website will serve as a means to present personal projects I have worked. Over time, my goal is to have this website host both R and Python programming projects regarding data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. To see projects I have completed so far, please refer to the title bar and click on the Projects page. If you would like, you could also click on the About page to read about me! To contact me, you could either use the form below or send me an email. My email can be found at the bottom of the page. Again, thank you for visiting my website!

Regards,

-Jeremy Kight
