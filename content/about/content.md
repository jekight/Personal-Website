Hi! My name is Jeremy Kight and I graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Chemical Engineering. However, for the past several years, I have been working in education as a high school mathematics instructor. It has been a privilege teaching young scholars about math and how it applies to their lives and the world. I have enjoyed gaining a deeper understanding about mathematical concepts as I teach them to others, while also building positive relationships with my students and coworkers. Outside of teaching, I have developed a personal passion for learning various programming languages and applying them to data. This has been a perfect mixture for me because I love learning and applying math, but I also love technology and innovations. Thus, once I started learning about data analysis, data science, and machine learning, I was hooked.


While I love these things because they interest and challenge me intellectually, they are not at the top of the totem pole that describes my life. My life is centered around God, as He provides and guides me through everything life throws at me. I am a follower of Christ, and I strive to live my life in a way that others may see Him through me. After God is my lovely wife, Mackenzie. At first, she terrified me, but with some help from a very good friend, I was able to land a date and we haven't looked back since. We are both very active; we love running, hiking, and traveling to new places to explore. I can honestly say no one challenges me quite like Mackenzie. Since meeting her, I have run numerous 5k's, walked entire cities, and even completed a classic Tough Mudder. Though I complain about how sore I get, I wouldn't change a thing because she is my favorite person in the world. Most recently, she bought us tickets to watch the Eagles (my favorite NFL team) play the Cowboys in Philadelphia… If there was an award for best wife in the world, she would definitely have my vote!
