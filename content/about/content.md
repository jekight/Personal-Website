Hi! My name is Jeremy Kight and I am a Texas Tech Alumni.I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. However, for the past several years I have been working in education trying to inform and encourage scholars about math and it's implications on their lives and the world. Through my experiences, I have had a blast being able to constantly gain a deeper understanding about mathematical concepts and build positive relationships with my students, as well as my coworkers! While teaching has certainly kept me busy, I have somehow found time to learn about various programming languages and how to apply them to data. This has been a perfect mixture for me because I absolutely love learning and applying math, but I also love technology and innovations. Thus, once I started learning about data analysis, data science, and machine learning, I was hooked. 

Again, I love those things because they interest and challenge me intellectually. However, they are not at the top of the totem pole that describes my life. My life is centered around God, as He provides and guides me through everything that life throws at me. I am a follower of Christ and do my best to live my life in a way so that others may see Him through me. Below God is my lovely wife, Mackenzie. She terrified me, but with some help from a very good friend, I was able to land a date and we haven't looked back since! We are both very active individuals, as we are always running, hiking, or just traveling to new places to explore. I can honestly say no that one challenges me quite like her! Since meeting her, I have ran numerous 5k's, walked entire cities, and even completed a classic tough mudder! Though I complain about how sore I get from those things, I wouldn't change a thing because she is my favorite person in the world. Have I mentioned that she bought us tickets to fly to Philadelphia to watch the Eagles play the Cowboys! I mean, any wife that takes her husband to see his favorite football team play their number one rival deserves an award right? If there was an award for best wife in the world, she would definitely have my vote!
