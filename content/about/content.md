Hi, my name is Jeremy Kight and I graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering. For the past few years, however, I have been working in education as a high school mathematics and physics instructor. It has been a privilege teaching young scholars about math and how it applies to their lives and the world. Outside of teaching, I have developed a personal passion for learning various programming languages and applying them to data. Due to my engineering and mathematics background, my strengths effectively align with the data analytics, data science, and machine learning fields; I have found these areas to combine my passions for both applied math and technological innovation. I recently received a data science certification and am working toward enrollment in a computer science masters program. 

While I enjoy these things because they interest and challenge me intellectually, they are not at the top of the totem pole that describes my life. My life is centered around God, as He provides and guides me through everything the world throws at me. I strive to live my life in a way that others may see Him through me. After God is my lovely wife, Mackenzie. At first, she terrified me, but with the help of a good friend, I landed a date and we haven't looked back since. We are both extremely active; we love running, hiking, and traveling to new places. No one challenges me quite like Mackenzie; since meeting her, I have run numerous 5k's, walked entire cities, and even completed a Tough Mudder. Last season, she even bought us tickets to watch the Eagles, my favorite NFL team, play the Cowboys in Philadelphia!
